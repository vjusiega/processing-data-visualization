# Data Visualization with Processing

This repo contains a series of [Processing](https://processing.org/) files that were created as classwork for [4.032 Design Studio: Information and Visualization](https://architecture.mit.edu/subject/spring-2020-4032) at MIT.

## Clocks

### Arc Clock 

The Arc Clock consists of three concentric arcs representing seconds, minutes and hours. The arcs disappear by a fraction with each corresponding time interval, making the clock more of a countdown until the next full minute, hour, or day.

### Orbit Clock

The Orbit Clock is inspired by planetary motion. The hour, minute, and second are each represented by a circle that moves in a circle as a clock hand would - but the centers of these circles are different for each time unit. The hour-dot creates the biggest circle, the minute-dot orbits the hour-dot, and the second-dot orbits the minute-dot. The three dots travel together as a unit through time.

### Mondrian Clock 

The Mondrian Clock is inspired by the famous geometric paintings by Piet Mondrian. Essentially, a square is first split up into *h* rectangles (h = the current hour). The largest rectangle is then split into *m* pieces (m = the current minute). Then a minute-rectangle is continuously split every second until the next full minute, at which time the said rectangle will split into two pieces to create the additional rectangle for the new minute. The same effect happens for the new hour. 

The three iterations of the Mondrian Clock play with the effect of line weight and color contrast.

## Weather Visualization 

### Abstract 

The abstract weather visualization uses a particle system that moves a speed proportional to the wind speed and that has colors coordinated with the temperature.
