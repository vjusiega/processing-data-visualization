# Data Visualization with Processing

This repo contains a series of [Processing](https://processing.org/) files that were created as classwork for [4.032 Design Studio: Information and Visualization](https://architecture.mit.edu/subject/spring-2020-4032) at MIT.

## Clocks

### Arc Clock 

The Arc Clock consists of three concentric arcs representing seconds, minutes and hours. The arcs disappear by a fraction with each corresponding time interval, making the clock more of a countdown until the next full minute, hour, or day.

### Orbit Clock

The Orbit Clock is inspired by planetary motion. The hour, minute, and second are each represented by a circle that moves in a circle as a clock hand would - but the centers of these circles are different for each time unit. The hour-dot creates the biggest circle, the minute-dot orbits the hour-dot, and the second-dot orbits the minute-dot. The three dots travel together as a unit through time.
